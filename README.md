# Easotools

Easotools helps you take raw data out of Easotope, and turn it into interpreted clumped isotope temperatures. It includes the ability to plot graphs with different error bars (confidence intervals or standard error), and to plot the fluid composition of the sample versus temperature and the isotopic composition of the carbonate mineral.
